**Primary persona – Hannah**


**Interviewee:** Sarina from Iran

**Occupation:** designer/artist, interior architecture student
**Age:** 23-24

**Search Tools:**
When she travels abroad, Sarina uses Facebook or asks locals for suggestions while searching for a place to go out. As well as that, she uses hashtags for the search or checks the artists' links of Soundcloud, YouTube to decide if this is the type of music she likes. Most of the time the events advertised on Facebook do not turn to be the ones she likes.

**Sarina’s Stand for apps:**
Sarina has not used apps for partying yet, but while traveling she uses apps like “Like a Local”, “Couchsurfing” and “Foursquare”. She does not pay much attention to the club/event’s ranking, but she checks the reviews written by other people.

**App and its usability:**
* The most used app feature for Sarina is filtering, which helps her to narrow down the choices.
* As well as that, as for a designer/artist, the visual appearance plays a big role – if she does not find it appealing, she stops using it.
* Finally, the app should be easy to use, because Sarina does not like to visit “Help” option.

**Trust:**
If the information that the app displays are valid and proven, Sarina will trust an app to guide in the foreign country. Steps to take before trusting an app is:
* Checking the reviews
* Goes to the place and checks how valid the information is
* If everything is ok, she will use an app again
Sarina trusts her friend’s advice to download an app. Sometimes digital advertisements on social media encourage her to use an app. As well as that, good reviews can influence her decision too.

**Narrow choices vs. the wide range of choices:**

As Sarina uses filters a lot, she prefers if the app can narrow down her options, as she tent to get overwhelmed with many choices. Sarina tends to like a different kind of electronic music so it would be nice to have few choices of various music directions.

**How does Sarina party?**

Most of the time Sarina likes to go to a party with the people she knows (preferably friends), but she also enjoys going on her separate way and rejoins them at some point. She thinks that friend-finding-app would save her lot of time and would make partying easier.

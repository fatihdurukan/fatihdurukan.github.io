## Testing of ClubTrips' Paper Prototype

{% include gallery id="gallery" layout="half" caption="**Preparation Process**" %}

## Test No.1:

**Testing Tasks:**

    * Filter and pick a house party playing techno music on the map.
    * Save an event and go there when you get a notification and give feedback to the party if it is necessary (by using a "Help" button).
    * Register and find your party crew members. 

**Issues:**

**Search button was a preferred choice for users.**
* Filtering - which was an important part of an app was hidden and hard to find.
* The need for the time option, event price, and user's birth date was unnecessary.
* The titles, text input, and other buttons looked similar.
* The necessity for registering had to be limited.
* Only Facebook and Gmail input for registering would be enough.
* The "Sign out" button had to be hidden.
* Questionable place and need for Feedback or Report button.
* An order in which the "Settings" were designed had to be overlooked.
* Ranking should be on a "Feedback" page (if there is one)
* **The "Menu" bar was missing (was not clear).**
* The function for registering the users had to be overlooked (Bluetooth might not be an option)
* Emojis and colors could be combined.

{% include gallery id="gallery2" layout="half" caption="**Preparation Process**" %}
 
## Test No.2:

**Changed testing tasks:**

* Find a house party nearby that plays a techno music on Dec.18
* Save an event and go there when you are notified. 
* Register your new crew and find its members on a map.
 
 {% include gallery id="gallery3" layout="half" caption="**Preparation Process**" %}

**Issues:**

* In "Search" was used differently than expected, especially when the date of an event and "Crew Finder" was typed.
* **On the paper prototype, it was unclear how to make some screens disappear.**
* The user was not briefed about the ClubTrips app, that is why it was difficult to understand the term "new crew" in the Task 3.
* In "Crew Finder" screen prototype, the usernames had to be separate papers for a better understanding of a process.
* When pushing the buttons on a map to see the friends, it would be nice if you could see their profiles (nickname + photo)

{% include gallery id="gallery4" layout="half" caption="**Preparation Process**" %}

## Test No.3:

**Changed testing tasks:**

* 2)Save an event and go there when you are notified. Rate an event afterward.

* 3)By using a "Crew Finding" app feature, register your new crew and find its members on a map.

{% include gallery id="gallery5" layout="half" caption="**Preparation Process**" %}

**Issues:**

* It was not clear in Task 2 which event the user had to save.
* The user could not find the way to escape a current screen.

## Test No.4:

**Changed testing tasks:**

* 2) Save a chosen event (House Party) and go there when you are notified. Rate it afterward.

{% include gallery id="gallery6" layout="half" caption="**Preparation Process**" %}

**Issues:**

* There was a confusion with the "Date" button - the user could not find a use.
* The user wishes to have an additional map on the party information screen.


## Summary:

**Most common issues:**

* Search button was a preferred choice for the most users.
* The "Menu" bar was missing or was not clear for the first two users.
* Users interacted differently with the paper prototype than they would digitally.

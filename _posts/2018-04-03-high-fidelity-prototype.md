## What is High Fidelity?

Description from [`Adobe Blog`](https://theblog.adobe.com/prototyping-difference-low-fidelity-high-fidelity-prototypes-use/) :
 
> High-fidelity prototyping
High-fidelity (hi-fi) prototypes appear and function as similar as possible to the actual product that will ship. Teams usually create high-fidelity prototypes when they have a solid understanding of what they are going to build and they need to either test it with real users or get final-design approval from stakeholders.
The basic characteristics of high-fidelity prototyping include:
Visual design: Realistic and detailed design — all interface elements, spacing, and graphics look just like a real app or website.
Content: Designers use real or similar-to-real content. The prototype includes most or all of the content that will appear in the final design.
Interactivity: Prototypes are highly realistic in their interactions.
Pros
Meaningful feedback during usability testing. High-fidelity prototypes often look like real products to users. This means that during usability testing sessions, test participants will be more likely to behave naturally — as if they were interacting with the real product.
Testability of specific UI elements or interactions. With hi-fi interactivity, it’s possible to test graphical elements like affordance or specific interactions, such as animated transitions and microinteractions.
Easy buy-in from clients and stakeholders. This type of prototype is also good for demonstrations to stakeholders. It gives clients and potential investors a clear idea of how a product is supposed to work. An excellent high-fidelity prototype gets people excited about your design in ways a lo-fi, bare-bones prototype can’t.
Cons
Higher costs. In comparison with low-fidelity prototypes, creating high-fidelity prototypes implies higher costs, both temporal and financial.

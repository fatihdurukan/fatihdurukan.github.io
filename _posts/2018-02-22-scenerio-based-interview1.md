## Aleksander's Scenario


**Interviewed Person:** Tahsin

Firstly, he said there isn’t something he would like to change the scenario because he liked the scenario.

He would prefer to use admin panel and application separately.

He thinks how much he would pay is depends on clubs because the budgets of clubs are different. And he also gave an example, if he was the owner of the Hollywood club, he could pay 50, 100 Euro for each event. And if he saw it is work, he would pay 200+ because he would take more Money than he paid.

He was asked the question “Does the app produce the same effect for any clubs” and he said it effects different because it depends on that day. What’s included in that day, are they giving a free alcohol or are they giving a free entrance etc?

Lastly, he was asked “If you’re a club owner, would you prefer to update it all the time you have a party coming or would you prefer to be synchronized with other applications” and he said if it Works automatically, I could choose that way. And he also mentioned that he could pay more for working automatically.

## Business Analysis of Cluptrips?

**Business Description**


Club Trips is a mobile application helping travelers find underground electronic music clubs worldwide. As well as that, it makes sure that clubbers never lose their party crew while being at the event.


## Problem
* 1.	Underground electronic music lovers waste lots of time to find a proper event while traveling abroad. Usually, it takes a couple of days to find a right venue that satisfies their music taste.
* 2.	After going out in large venue spaces, huge electronic music festivals or big clubs, it is easy to lose your party friends.


## Solution

A mobile application (Android/ iOS ) that is targeted to people that search for underground electronic music events while traveling.
* It shows them the parties in their neighborhood that satisfy their taste (including house parties) and notifies them if the pop-up events are taking place.
* The app prevents its users to lose each other while being out. It allows them to register the party crew (under a name, color, Emoji) and track each other while being out.
Assuming that we have more than 100,000 users, we are planning to make profit from premium membership, advertisement, getting commission from ticket sales and prices of creating events in the app.

## Five Forces Model

**Competitive rivalry:** There are already similar apps out there but our target group of clients is more specific. And we are going to look into the problems these already established apps have come across and do those things better. Since it is an app, it is important to focus on the visual side and the easiness of using the app.

We have searched for the possible competitive mobile applications and software companies in market, and we have found three of them:

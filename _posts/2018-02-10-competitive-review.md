## Clubbing Tribe 
Clubbing Tribe is an app which you can share clubbing experience with your friends, your party photos and events you are going. You can also follow what your favorite Clubs post as Upcoming music events, Promotions and Discounts.

**Platform:** Android

The bad thing first I see when open app: it is required to login via Facebook. But a user may not have a Facebook account.

After login, the user can choose own style (Classic, Country, Disco etc.), view all events, find local clubs, see his/her friends, view gallery and look clubs followed.

There are limited cities for clubs. There is an autocomplete input in Find Local Clubs page. You type some words but nothing appears under.

**The possible users of this system:** Persons who look for clubs and parties around. This person's gender can be man/woman, age can be young or adult etc. Their goals is to provide a list of local clubs and shows parties them.

**Good:** The app is easy to use and includes icons for widgets.

**Bad:** The app color was chosen dark and there is no chance to change it. And the app is not responsive too. When switching it to horizontal or vertical it doesn't reposition itself.

**Business model of the system:** There are three plans to choose: Basic, Premium and VIP. Basic has three events for free. Premium has five events and its cost is €19.99 (per month). And the last one has unlimited events for €29.99 (per month).

There are discounts also: "Buy 5 months - get 1 month free" and "Buy 10 months - get 2 months free".

Also Clubbing Tribe has over 5000 accounts and 100+ Clubs.

**Similarities/Differences:** The project idea is similar in general perspective. But our app's focus is only for travelers. And there will be also choice public parties or underground parties. And to use this app, user must be logged via Facebook. The differences will be able to increase later.

* ClubTrips has unique feature of tracking your party group, which helps you to not get lost while partying in foreign sights

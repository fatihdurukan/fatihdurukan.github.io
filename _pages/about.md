Hello,

I am Fatih, I have graduated as a computer engineer from Istanbul University in September 2018. Since I would like to code, I would prefer to call myself "Software Engineer" rather than "Computer Engineer". Hardware/electronics classes were not my favorite in college :)

I am a Turkish man in the USA!
